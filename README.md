# Brute Force Attack and Access Control Simulation  

## Project Goal  
This project demonstrates a brute force attack simulation using Python on Azure virtual machines to highlight the importance of cybersecurity principles such as password policies, firewall management, and access control.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Paramiko)  
- Microsoft Azure (Red Team and Blue Team virtual machines)  
- Windows Event Viewer  
- Splunk  

## Overview  
The Red Team executed brute force login attempts and dropped an image file using Paramiko, while the Blue Team monitored and analyzed logs through Event Viewer and Splunk. This hands-on simulation emphasizes detection, analysis, and prevention strategies in real-world attack scenarios.
